Description
--------
Gotta love the NES. I had seen a few designs around here, but none of them color-printable. So after a few trial-redesign rounds, here is the final result :)

Instructions
--------
1) Print the body in white, A+B in red, and cross+start+select in blue/black.<br />
2) Assemble all the buttons, you can use soft foam to make them "press-able".<br />
3) 2D print the sticker (if you happen to have one of those rare 2D printer), plastify it, cut the holes with an X-Acto knife, and glue it in place.<br />
4) You can also put a cable with a connector to make it even more realistic.<br />
<br />
Design made in Sketchup. Again, I'm sorry for that. Summer is near and I will learn OpenSCAD soon.
