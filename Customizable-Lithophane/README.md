Description
--------
After printing a few square lithophanes I realized the corners usually got off the printbed.  <br />
In order to fix that, here is the non-square (polygonal) version of the lithophane generator.  <br />
<br />
Special mention to this other customizable lithophane by **MichaelAtOz:** <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:78719" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">thingiverse.com/thing:78719</a> <br />
<br />
Original description from Makerbot:  <br />
--  <br />
Click "Open in Customizer" to turn the image of your choice into a Lithopane! We used the Mona Lisa, but you could use any photo you want. The Lithopane tool generates a 3D model that looks like a rough terrain map.  <br />
<br />
Download the file, print it on your MakerBot Desktop 3D Printer, and you've got a picture perfect pane to hang on your window.  <br />
<br />
Three cheers for the lithopane pioneers on Thingiverse, such as cymon and pp3dpNL! For more information on this old art form, check out the Wikipedia article here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane</a>

Instructions
--------
Original instructions from Makerbot:  <br />
--  <br />
Upload an image, check the invert colors checkbox and create a Lithopane. For best results, upload a square image and print using a light colored plastic at 0.2 mm layer height and 1 shell.  <br />
<br />
Once printed, hang your picture in a window.
