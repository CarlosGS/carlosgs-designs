Description
--------
Our glass door had stopped keeping itself closed, so I made this parametric part to fix it.<br />
Now the door closes properly, which helps saving energy by preventing heat-flows.<br />
<br />
Check the pictures for details.

Instructions
--------
Modify the .scad parameters, print and screw the piece in place.<br />
<br />
In the pictures you can see I put some white glue to make sure the piece doesn't move. Now this glue it is dry and has turned clear.
