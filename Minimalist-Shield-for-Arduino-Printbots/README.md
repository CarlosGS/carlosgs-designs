Description
--------
Simple shield board that allows to connect servo-motors and other devices (like sensors) to the analog pins of an Arduino board (UNO or MEGA).<br />
It also has a connector for the batteries.<br />
<br />
You can use it in printbots like the MiniSkybot or the ArduSnake! (http://www.thingiverse.com/tag:printbot).

Instructions
--------
----- Building tips -----<br />
  This circuit can be made easily using pre-drilled PCB board.<br />
  You can push the header pins all the way trough to be able to solder them on the other side of the PCB, even with one-layer designs like this one.<br />
<br />
----- Notes -----<br />
  I have made some tests with an ArduSnake, using a previous version of the same circuit. Here is a video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEkTYmGqIWo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">youtube.com/watch?v=oEkTYmGqIWo</a><br />
  Still need to make this PCB, but as far I can tell it will work.<br />
  Analog pins can be used as digital:<br />
------ A0 -&gt; pin 14 <br />
------ <br />
------ A6 -&gt; pin 19<br />
  It is my first design using Kicad, please excuse my mistakes.<br />
<br />
----- Progress -----<br />
  16/05/12 Built OK, here is a video: <a href="http://youtu.be/zC5MKcnZ27Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">youtu.be/zC5MKcnZ27Q</a><br />
  02/05/12 Made a paper version and uploaded pictures<br />
