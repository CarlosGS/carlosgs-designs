Description
--------
I wanted to share my improvements on the great printable hexapod by Ijon:<br />
- an STL plate for printing in small machines like the Printrbot Jr<br />
- Sample Arduino source code based on the ArduSnake oscillators library by Obijuan

Instructions
--------
Print, put everything together (with screws and hot-glue), connect, program and enjoy :)<br />
<br />
For the Arduino code, you will need to install the ArduSnake oscillators library <a href="https://github.com/Obijuan/ArduSnake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">github.com/Obijuan/ArduSnake</a><br />
It is a very simple code thanks to the power of this library :)<br />
<br />
Here is a demo video showing some patterns: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPwyOtpsSBA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">youtube.com/watch?v=FPwyOtpsSBA</a><br />

All credit of the design goes to Ijon (http://www.thingiverse.com/Ijon), thank you! :)
